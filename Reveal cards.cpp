Question :-
So the question says i will do a certain operation while i am picking the elements from the array and when the operations are over the cards in my hand should be of sorted order.

the pattern:
1.Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.

2.If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.

3.Repeat step 1.

so how can we approach this we can either go recursivey to find the soln. or can make the soln ourselves from base.

Approach 1: (Using Dequeue)
let us take one example first to better understand the pattern.
Example 1:

Input: deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]

Explanation:
We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order does not matter), and reorder it.
After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.
1.Take 2, and move 13 to the bottom. The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].2.Take 3, and move 11 to the bottom. The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].
3.Take 5, and move 17 to the bottom. The deck is now [7,13,11,17].
4.Take 7, and move 13 to the bottom. The deck is now [11,17,13].
5.Take 11, and move 17 to the bottom. The deck is now [13,17].
6.Take 13, and move 17 to the bottom. The deck is now [17].
7.Take 17. as there are no elements left break the loop.

Consider building the array and analyzing from below you can see the gist of the soln:

ex. on step 4. we can see that before 11 is added the last element 17 was move to the first and then 11 is added.
thus this pattern continues further

we can see that the whenever a element is added in the front the last element is popped and brought to the first of the queue and then the ordered element is added right.

so we can achieve this via deque. if a element is present we just have to pop the element and add it to the first and then add the element to the array.

Thats it you have your soln. Give it a go yourself guys!! before seeing soln..

Code :-
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> deckRevealedIncreasing(vector<int>& deck) {

        int n = deck.size();
        std::sort(deck.begin(), deck.end());
        std::deque<int> st;
        st.push_front(deck[n - 1]);
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            st.push_front(st.back());
            st.pop_back();
            st.push_front(deck[i]);
        }
        std::vector<int> revealed;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            revealed.push_back(st.front());
            st.pop_front();
        }
        return revealed;
    }
};
