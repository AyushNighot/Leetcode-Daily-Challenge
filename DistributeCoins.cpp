Interviewee:
Let's start with the brute-force approach. In this problem, we need to ensure that every node ends up with exactly one coin. A simple, yet inefficient way to solve the problem would be to simulate the process by iterating multiple passes until every node is balanced.

Steps:
For each node, check if it has more (or fewer) than one coin.
If a node has excess coins, try to move them to adjacent nodes.
Count every move.
Repeat the process until all nodes have exactly one coin.
Interviewer:
What would the time and space complexity of this brute-force approach be?

Interviewee:
The brute-force approach would likely have a high time complexity because in the worst-case we might need to iteratively inspect each node and perform moves until all nodes are balanced. Specifically, the time complexity could be O(n^2) due to possibly rechecking nodes multiple times.

The space complexity would be O(n) since we need storage proportional to the number of nodes to keep track of the coins distribution.

Optimized Approach
Interviewee:
To optimize, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to compute a more efficient solution. The idea is to treat moving coins in the tree as a flow problem where coins are transferred within the constraints until the nodes are balanced.

Optimized Steps:
Perform a DFS traversal of the tree.
For each node, calculate the excess or deficit coins after considering its sub-tree.
The total moves required will be the sum of absolute values of excess/deficit transferred to/from child nodes.
Interviewer:
Can you explain this with a drawing?

Drawing Explanation
Let's use the example root = [3, 0, 0]:

    3
   / \
  0   0
Starting at the root (node 3), it has 2 excess coins to be distributed: 3 - 1 = 2.
From node 3, it could move these 2 coins to its children (1 coin to each child).
    1
   / \
  1   1
Here, we'll need exactly 2 moves:

1 move to transfer a coin to the left child.
1 move to transfer a coin to the right child.
Interviewer:
What are the time and space complexities for this optimized approach?

Interviewee:
The time complexity is O(n) since we perform a single DFS traversal through the tree, visiting each node exactly once.

The space complexity is O(h) where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case for a skewed tree, this can be O(n). For a balanced tree, it would be O(log n).

Interviewer:
Okay, that sounds good. So, we can summarize that using a DFS traversal method is both time and space efficient for this problem.

Shall we move on to writing the actual code?

Interviewee:
Sure! Here's a possible code implementation for the optimized approach:

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def distributeCoins(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.moves = 0
        
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return 0
            
            left_excess = dfs(node.left)
            right_excess = dfs(node.right)
            
            self.moves += abs(left_excess) + abs(right_excess)
            
            return node.val + left_excess + right_excess - 1
        
        dfs(root)
        return self.moves
This code uses a DFS method to calculate and move excess coins efficiently.
Sure! Here's the implementation of the distributeCoins function in various languages, along with the time and space complexity comments.

class Solution {
public:
    int moves = 0;

    int dfs(TreeNode* node) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        int left_excess = dfs(node->left);
        int right_excess = dfs(node->right);
        moves += abs(left_excess) + abs(right_excess);
        return node->val + left_excess + right_excess - 1;
    }

    int distributeCoins(TreeNode* root) {
        dfs(root);
        return moves;
    }
};

// Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
// Space Complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack).
