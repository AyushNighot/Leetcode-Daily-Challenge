Complexity
The overall space and time complexities of the code are as follows:

Space Complexity:

The space complexity primarily arises from maintaining the adjacency list representation of the graph, the visited array to track visited vertices, and the recursive call stack during the depth-first search (DFS) traversal.
The space complexity for the adjacency list is O(n + E), where n is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
The space complexity for the visited array is O(n), where n is the number of vertices.
The space complexity for the recursive call stack in the DFS traversal is O(n), where n is the number of vertices.
Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n + E).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time Complexity:

The time complexity is primarily determined by the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm used to traverse the graph.
The DFS algorithm visits each vertex and each edge at most once.
Therefore, the time complexity is O(n + E), where n is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
In summary, the overall space complexity is O(n + E), and the overall time complexity is also O(n + E).
